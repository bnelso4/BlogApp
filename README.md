This App lets you create edit view and delete blog posts which are retrieved and saved to a Json server 

To use app create a json development server with blogposts as an empty array in the database. Application uses Axios for the API calls and the base URL is the only thing needed to get it Running.

Demonstrates use of Context and Reducers as well as http API calls. Built using the react native framework.

Built as part of the complete react native and hooks course, with additional styling created by me
